# Flutter Flow NFT Catalog

This project is being built or the Flow Hackathon (February/2023).

We are extending the Flow NFT Catalog to a mobile native version!
We are using Flutter.
To query the blockchain and use the NFT Catalog contract, we are using the Swift-FCL SDK!

In this app you can view the catalog and query for all NFTs of an account.
